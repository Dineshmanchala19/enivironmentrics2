EnvironMetrics is a Flask-based web app for satellite image analysis. It calculates NDVI, NDWI, and NSMI from TIFF files and visualizes the results. The app supports user authentication and stores data in MongoDB. It also uses the Random Forest algorithm for NDVI, NDWI, and NSMI change map classification, with a clean UI built using Tailwind CSS.
